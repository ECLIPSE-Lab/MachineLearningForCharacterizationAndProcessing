Specifically tailored for students interested in the new BSc program \"KI-Materialtechnologie\"/AI for materials technology\", it provides hands-on experience with core and advanced machine learning methods—including neural networks, optimization strategies, and generative modelling—to tackle real-world materials science problems. The course focuses on experimental data: microstructures, images, spectra, and processing parameters, connecting the messy, nonlinear world of processing and characterization signals with machine learning tools.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  This course teaches how to apply machine learning to materials science problems, focusing on experimental data from characterization techniques (microscopy, spectroscopy) and processing parameters. Students learn to build ML pipelines for microstructure classification, process prediction, and spectral analysis, with emphasis on understanding the physics of data formation and avoiding common pitfalls in experimental ML workflows.\nkey-points:\n  - Machine learning techniques for materials processing and characterization data\n  - Vision-based ML for microstructure analysis and classification\n  - Time-series ML for process monitoring and optimization\n  - Spectral data analysis using dimensionality reduction and ML\n  - Multi-modal data fusion combining images, spectra, and process parameters\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n:::{#542fa22c .cell .markdown}\n# Machine Learning in Materials Processing & Characterization\n\n**4th Semester – 5 ECTS, 2h lecture + 2h exercises per week**\n\n## Synergy Map\n\n- **This course**: What ML can do with experimental data: microstructures, images, spectra, processing parameters.\n\n- **Parallel ML intro course**: Teaches generic ML algorithms and image processing foundations (skimage, Fourier, wavelets, SVMs, Bayes classifiers).\n\n- **\"Materials Genomics\" course**: Focuses on materials databases, descriptors, crystal graph representations, DFT data, high-throughput workflows, surrogate models.\n \n\n## Week-by-Week Curriculum (14 weeks)\n\n### Unit I — Foundations: From Materials Signals to Machine Learning (Weeks 1–3)\n\n#### Week 1 – What makes materials data special?\n\n- Types of data: micrographs, EBSD, EDS, EELS, XRD, process logs, thermal profiles, deformation curves.\n- PSPP (Processing–Structure–Property–Performance) as a data graph.\n- Why vision-based ML and time-series ML are central to processing & characterization.\n\n#### Week 2 – Image formation & the physics of data\n\n- How characterization creates data: resolution, contrast mechanisms, artifacts.\n- Fourier optics intuition for students with their ML-intro foundations.\n- Sampling, aliasing, denoising as model-based priors.\n\n#### Week 3 – Experimental data quality & ML-readiness\n\n- Annotation, segmentation, inter-annotator variance.\n- Train/test leakage in materials workflows.\n\n \n\n### Unit II — ML for Microstructure: Vision & Representation (Weeks 4–6)\n\n#### Week 4 – Classical microstructure quantification & its ML extension\n\n- Grain size, phase fractions, orientation maps, lineal intercepts.\n- From hand-crafted features → learned representations.\n\n#### Week 5 – Convolutional Neural Networks for microstructure classification\n \n\n- CNN filters as microstructure interpreters.\n- Example tasks: grain-boundary segmentation, precipitate detection, melt pool defects.\n\n\n\n#### Week 6 – Transfer learning & data scarcity in materials characterization\n\n- How to train a model with 200 images instead of 200k.\n- Representations from ImageNet vs self-supervised pretraining on microstructures.\n\n### Unit III — ML in Processing: Time-Series, Optimization, Thermal/Mechanical Data (Weeks 7–9)\n\n#### Week 7 – Process monitoring & time-series ML\n\n- Process logs: temperature cycles, additive manufacturing melt pool monitoring, SPS, rolling, heat treatment.\n- Hidden Markov models, ARIMA, random forest regressors, RNNs (light introduction).\n\n#### Week 8 – Process → structure regression & uncertainty\n\n- Gaussian Processes (synergy with Materials Genomics' surrogate models, but here linked to experimental data).\n- Uncertainty as a tool for process design.\n\n#### Week 9 – Inverse problems in processing\n\n- ML-guided process maps (AM: laser power vs scan speed;
